          <h3>What is Ayurved?</h3>
          <p>Ayu = Life</p>
          <p>Veda = Knowledge</p>
          <p>The science of Longevity.</p>
			<p>Ayurved is a Sanskrit term made up of the words Ayu and
			    Veda. Ayu means Life and Veda means Knowledge or science.
			    The term Ayurveda refers to knowledge of life or science
			    of life.</p>
			<p>According to ancient Ayurvedic scholar Charak, Ayu comprises
			    the body (शरीर), senses (इंद्रिय), mind (सत्व) and soul (आत्मा)</p>
			<p>Ayurveda is the world’s oldest medical science, which originated
			    in India over 5,000 yrs ago. The fundamentals of Ayurveda can
			    be found in Hindu scriptures called Vedas.</p>
			<p>It is not only a medicinal system, but a form of lifestyle
			    adopted to maintain perfect balance and harmony within the
			    human existence.</p>
			<p>It is a art of living and science of healing, adapting the
			    Ayurvedic way of life is valuable first step towards becoming
			    the truly integrated individual.</p>
			<p>Thus Ayurveda offers a unique blend of science and philosophy
			    that balance the physical, mental, emotional and spiritual
			    components necessary for holistic health.</p>

			<h2>Aim of Ayurveda</h2>
			<p>The aim of Ayurveda is to prevent illness, heal the sick and
			    preserve life—</p>
			<p>स्वस्थस्य स्वास्थ्य रक्षणम ।।</p>
			<p>To protect health and prolong life.</p>
			<p>
              आतुरस्य विकार प्रशामनंश्च ।।
            </p>
			<p>
              To eliminate disease and disfunctions of the body.
            </p>
			
			<h2>Basic principles of Ayurveda</h2>
			<p>Ayurveda is based on two fundamental theories – Panchamahabhut and
			    Tridosh theory.</p>
			<p>Ayurvedic philosophy believes that everything in the universe is
			    made up of five elements. Space (आकाश), Air (वायू), Fire (तेज),
			    Water (जल), Earth (पृथ्वी) represented in human by three Doshas
			    or Energies – Vaat, Pitta, Kapha. When any of Doshas accumulate
			    in the body beyond the desirable limit, the body loses its balance.
			    Every individual has distinct balance of these Doshas called Prakriti.
			    Our health and well being depend on getting a right balance of the
			    three Doshas.</p>
			<h2>What is Panchakarama</h2>

			<p>Panchakaramas is Ayurveda’s primary purification and detoxification
			    treatment. Panchakarma means five therapies. These five therapeutic
			    treatments eliminate toxins from the body, while balancing the Doshas.</p>
